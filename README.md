# study-design

Choose an area of interest (e.g. protein supplementation for muscle hypertrophy or the effect of block periodization on VO2max). Find at least five original research studies1 in your selected area and describe strength and weakness of these studies (see below). The report should focus on the design of the studies and selection of statistical tests to answer study aims. Conclude your report with a recommendation, how should future studies in your area be designed to best answer similar questions?
